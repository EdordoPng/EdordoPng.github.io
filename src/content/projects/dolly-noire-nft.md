## Project Overview

This project marks the entry of **Dolly Noire**, a leading Italian streetwear brand, into the Web3 space.
As the **NFT Project Director**, I led the initiative from ideation to launch, defining the business strategy that bridged physical fashion with digital ownership ("Phygital").

The collection, named **Cyberdecks**, consists of 4 drops (King, Queen, Jack, Joker) featuring interactive 3D cards.

## My Role: Strategy & Product

I managed the entire lifecycle of the project, focusing on the intersection of marketing and technology:
* **Business Plan & Pitch:** Defined the value proposition for the brand's stakeholders.
* **Launch Strategy:** Coordinated advertising campaigns and community engagement on Discord.
* **Gamification (Tokenomics):** Designed a point-based system ("Figures Combo") where holding specific combinations of NFTs unlocks real-world rewards (trips, limited edition clothing, events). This incentivized long-term holding over quick flipping.

## Technical Architecture: The Art Engine

To generate the **400+ unique 3D assets**, we moved away from standard tools and built a custom solution.
I designed the architectural logic for a robust **Art Engine in Java 11**, which was optimized to handle high-resolution layers and metadata generation, achieving **80% faster** creation times compared to Python-based alternatives available at the time.

### Technical Collaboration
The core development of the Art Engine was executed in synergy with my technical partner:
* **Marco Sorrentino** (Lead Developer): [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marco-sorrentino-23b069193) | [GitHub](https://github.com/WeDev00)

## The "Phygital" Utility

The project wasn't just digital art; it had tangible utility:
1.  **Values:** Each card belongs to a deck (Gold, Silver, Black, Red, Blue) with different rarity scores.
2.  **Combos:** Collecting a "Poker" of figures unlocks tier-based rewards (e.g., "SUPER Combo" = 3 years of free clothing).
3.  **Integration:** The NFTs serve as a digital pass for exclusive Dolly Noire events and the "Family Program".
