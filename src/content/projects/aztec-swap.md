## Project Overview

**AztecSwap** is a Proof-of-Concept for a privacy-preserving Decentralized Exchange (DEX). 
It leverages **Aztec's Noir**, a Domain Specific Language for Zero-Knowledge (ZK) proofs, to enable private token swaps on Ethereum. The goal was to demonstrate how "Programmable Privacy" can be applied to DeFi, allowing users to trade without revealing sensitive transaction data on-chain.
